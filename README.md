# QuadrupletsPositionsApp
QuadrupletsPositions is a bioinformatics tool developed to perform some basic bioinformatics analysis of genome. We wont to provide easy in using program with convenient graphical user interface. 
Now our program allows to compute relative introgenic position of codons(or quadruplets) and visualisate this data.
Written in C++ using Qt as framework.
More features will be added in future...

Features:
  -Can downloading genomes from NCBI server using NCBI API (Currently don't work on Windows properly)\n
  -Can make calculations with triplets and tetraplets\n
  -Can use spline or line plotting\n

Bugs:
  -Downloading doesn't work on Windows systems
